# Elwanda June's Cookbook

This is a simple HTML/CSS static website, hosted via GitHub Pages, featuring several nostalgic recipes that my grandmother made for my family throughout the years. I have also included images from her cookbooks, including vintage ephemera that was tucked inside the pages.

Please check out the site at [ElwandaJune.com] (http://elwandajune.com).
